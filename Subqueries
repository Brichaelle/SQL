Here, subqueires were perfomed on previously joined tables to find averages

SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS "Average"
FROM (SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name AS "customer_first_name", A.last_name AS "customer_last_name", D.country, C.city,
    SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount-paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE city IN('London', 'Aurora', 'Santiago de Compostela', 'Iwaki', 'Shanwei', 'Nador', 'Tianjin', 'Rustenburg', 'Newcastle')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5 AS total_amount_paid
